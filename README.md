# Welcome to my algos work!

## ABOUT
These algorithms are used by me to practice and get a better sense of algorithms. 

## WHAT TO USE TO RUN CODE
Each .js is used along-side with "nodemon" to observe changes while I work. Most, if not all work, will print out an outcome when you run it. For more information on "nodemon" please click [here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).

## WORKFLOW
Each file will generally have: 1) Required constructors, 2) Instatiating of raw values into new instances of constructors, and 3) Comments each block of code.

// PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK. I AM OPEN TO CONSTRUCT CRITICSM. :)
