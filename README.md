# Welcome to my algos work!

## ABOUT
These algorithms are used by me to practice and get a better sense of algorithms. 

## WHAT TO USE TO RUN CODE
Each .js is used along-side with "nodemon" to observe changes while I work. Most, if not all work, will print out an outcome when you run it. For more information on "nodemon" please click [here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).

## WORKFLOW
Each file will generally have: 1) Required constructors, 2) Instatiating of raw values into new instances of constructors, and 3) Comments each block of code.

## CONTENT
### SSL
- addNode - Given an SLL and a value, add a node with that value to the SLL
- intersection - Given a two SLLs, check to see if the lists intersect
- isPalindrome - Given a SLL, determine if the values are palindrome. Return 1 or 0 if is palindrome or not, respectively
- kthNode - Given a SLL, find Kth node from the end of the list
- mergeTwo - Given a two, sorted SLLs, merge both lists into one
- removeNode
  <br>
  ex.1) Given an SLL, replace head node with the node after head
  <br>
  ex.2) Given an SLL, replace tail with node before tail
  <br>
  ex.3) Given and SLL, remove the middle node with the node before it
 - reverseSll - Given an SLL, reverse the SLL
 - sort012 - Given an SLL with random amounts of values of 0, 1, 2, sort the SLL so that all values are sorted from smallest to largest

### Stacks
  - constructor
  <br>
  ex.1) Define a Stack that allows for a linked list of strings
  <br>
  ex.2) Define a Stack that allows for an array of strings
  <br>
  ex.3) Define a Stack that allows for key/value pairs
  <br>
  
  - findMinMaxAvg
  <br>
  ex.1) Given a Stack w/ SLL, return the minimum value
  <br>
  ex.2) Given a Stack w/ SLL, return the maximum value
  <br>
  ex.3) Given a Stack w/ SLL, return the average value
